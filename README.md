# Arduino-Test-Platform
Using a GUI on PC to send commands to Arduino via serial port. The purpose of this project is having a way to interact with the physical world, for example controlling the state of some GPIO pin. This in fact will simplify the test procedures by avoiding an annoying flashing and re-flashing of the Arduino program memory.
